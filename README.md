## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port 3000 in use**:

   # Find and kill process using port 3000
   netstat -ano | findstr :3000
   taskkill /PID <process_id> /F
   ```

2. **Database issues**:
   - **Data lost**: Database now persists automatically

   - Ensure file is image format
   - Verify uploads directory exists
